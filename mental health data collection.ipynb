      "Process\n",
      "1. Peer educators divide the class into small group of 10-15 students. They ask the group members to\n",
      "share some episode when they felt really sad.\n",
      "2. Then request each group to share their responses and write them on the black board. Common\n",
      "responses include the following:\n",
      "• Someone passed away • We changed house.\n",
      "• A friend moves away. • A brother or sister leaves home.\n",
      "• A pet dies. • I failed in a subject.\n",

      "something/someone loves is taken away.\n",
      "4. Peer educators brainstorm with the whole group by asking “How do people express sadness?” They\n",

      "Key Messages\n",
      " Sadness is a natural response and a personal experience.\n",
      " How one experiences sadness depends on several factors, including temperament, personality traits\n",

He\\nwould push other children. Not only in the classroom, but in the playground as well. He would\\ntake their lunches and sometimes even call them names.\\nBishno had no friends. Until one day a new boy named Rahil came to the same school. Bishno\\nstarted right off pushing Rahil around. But, the more he tried to disturb Rahil, the more Rahil\\nwould talk to him and tell him that he just wanted to be his friend. He said \"Why do you always\\ntry to make others not like you? We could be good friends.\"\\nBishno started thinking. He said \"Maybe we could be friends. ok, let’s try it. We could eat lunch\\ntogether.\" So that\\'s what they did. After school they walked home together. They also found out\\nthat they lived close to each other.\\nSo, from that day on Bishno and Rahil were the best of friends. Bishno also made other friends\\nbecause of his friendship with Rahil. He found that being a friend made him a lot happier than\\nbeing a bully.\\nAre you wondering if you are a bully? Here’s a quick way to tell. Look at the following list. If your\\nanswer is “yes” to any two or more of these questions, you could become a bully and you need to find\\nways to change your behavior.\\nMental Health and Wellbeing — A Perspective | 56i.

It is continuous\\neffort to maintain a relationship, not to hurt people, and if hurt, how to deal with it. All of us have people\\nin our lives that matter to us the most and we depend up on others for support. Both verbal and non-\\nverbal gestures are used to initiate and maintain friendship. Verbal communication includes introducing\\noneself, what they do and who they are, etc. on the other side, non-verbal gestures include making eye-\\ncontact, holding hands, shaking hands, hugging, etc.\\nProcess\\n2. Divide the adolescents into two random groups, with equal numbers in each group. Let the adolescent\\nfrom two circular groups, facing each other. Maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between the two.\\n3. Make both the group stand opposite to each other.\\n4. Now tell them to step forward and greet each other one by one.\\n5. Ask them to go back to their original position after greeting.\\n6. Now ask the adolescents to assemble once again in two random groups and share with one another\\nnot only non-verbal gestures but also share a few words of who they and what they doetc.\\n7. Now ask them to discuss with the whole class on how they felt sharing with each other such verbal\\nand Non-verbal greetings.\\nPossible Responses\\nGreetings each other with non-verbal gestures\\n\\uf0d8 Bending and folding hands\\n\\uf0d8 Shaking hands and smiling\\n\\uf0d8 Hugging and patting on the back\\n\\uf0d8 Eye to eye contact and asmile.\\nMental Health and Wellbeing — A Perspective | 68Verbal Gestures\\n\\uf0d8 “Hi, I am Seema, I live in Delhi.”\\n\\uf0d8 “I am Naren.

Ask each adolescent, one by one, to share how she/he was feeling while entering the classroom.\\n2. Divide the class into groups of four adolescents each.\\n3. Ask them to express their feelings that they have experienced earlier in any desired manner, whether\\nit be drawing, singing, dancing, speech.\\nPossible Responses\\nHappy Joyful Silly Unhappy Jealous\\nPleased Sparkling Angry Depressed Annoyed\\nCheerful Jolly Sad Suspicious Irritated\\nComfortable Warm Lonely Uncertain Furious\\nLight hearted Thrilled Isolated Bitter Offended\\nAssessment of Activity\\nAssess if adolescents are comfortable with one another. If you feel that they are not, extend the discussion\\nfurther. If they are comfortable, proceed to the next activity.\\nKey-Messages\\n\\uf0fc It is important for adolescents to realize that the feelings they have and their rapid changes in mood\\nare normal in adolescents.\\n\\uf0fc This will enable them to accept and deal with their emotions instead of being afraid or frustrated.\\n\\uf0fc They will be able to recognize the emotions within themselves and others.\\n\\uf0fc Adolescents will become aware of how emotions influence behavior and will also be able to respond\\nto emotions appropriately.\\nMental Health and Wellbeing — A Perspective | 70Activity-5: Understanding Anger\\nObjectives of the Activity Time: 30-40 minutes\\nStudents will\\n• Identify healthy and unhealthy reactions to anger\\n• Exchange and share ideas on healthy ways to deal with anger\\nMaterials\\n• Refer to Table showing “When you are Angry you are most like…….” (for the facilitator /peer\\neducators)\\n• Pens or pencils, marker board, blackboard or chalk.\\nProcess\\n1. Write “A” and “B” with chalk on the floor on the two\\nopposite sides of the room.\\n2. The facilitator reads from “When you are Angry you are\\nmost like…….” and asks students to make their own\\nchoice.\\n3. Based on their respective choice, students have to stand\\nin either “A”area or “B”.\\n4. After each choice is read and students make their own\\nchoices, the facilitator asks them to explain why they\\nmade that particular choice.\\n5. Then get the group back together and go on to the next\\nset of choices. The facilitator leads a group discussion\\namong the students using the prompts given below.\\nDiscussion Prompts\\n1. What was your reason to pick your response?\\n2. Explain the benefits of being like a cat vs. a tiger.\\n3. How does behaving like a lake feel?\\n4. What do you think about your choice?Is it really the best choice?\\nAppendices | 716. The facilitator using the answers of the ‘Discussion Prompts’ takes opinions on whether their\\nresponse is healthy or unhealthy.\\n7. The facilitator summarizes the session using the Key messages given below.\\nKey Messages\\n• Anger is a natural emotion. However, how we behave in anger is under our\\ncontrol.\\n• There are healthy and unhealthy ways of expressing anger.\\n• Some simple steps you can try to manage your anger are:\\no Breathe deeply. Picture your breath coming up from your \"gut.\"\\no Slowly repeat a calm word or phrases such as \"relax,\" \"take it easy.” Repeat it to yourself while\\nbreathing deeply.\\no Visualize a relaxing experience, from either your memory or your imagination.\\no Yoga-like activities can relax your muscles and make you feel much calmer.\\nReference Table\\nWhen you feel angry, you are more like......\\nA B\\nPond River\\nHammer Nail\\nSwimmer Cricket player\\nGuitar Trumpet\\nTiger Kitty cat\\nLava Rain\\nMental Health and Wellbeing — A Perspective | 72Activity-6: Controlling Anger\\nObjectives of the Activity\\nStudents will\\n• Understand the connection between thoughts and emotions.\\n• Learn and practice self-instruction training for managing anger.\\nMaterials\\n• Role –play scenarios for ‘Controlling Anger’ for the students.\\n• Explain the Handout for “Controlling Anger” (teachers/facilitators only)\\n• Pens or pencils, marker, board,chalk.\\nProcess\\n1. Facilitators discuss with participants the rationale for the topic. They can provide information about\\nhow our thoughts may influence our emotions. The facilitators may also provide the following\\nexamples:\\n• Our friend shouts at us. If we think she wants to show us down, we will get angry or ifwe think\\nthat she is just having a bad day, we may not get angry or at least less angry.\\n• Our brother/sister spills something on our school project. If we think he/she did it deliberately\\nto get us into trouble, we will get angry. If we tell ourselves it was just an accident, we are less\\nlikely to get angry.\\n• Mother comes home late. You have come back from school and are hungry and waiting for her\\nto give you food.\\na. If we think she is shopping and having fun without you, we are going to get angry.\\nb. Or, if we think she has been stuck with some important work, we may feel worried.\\nc. And if we think she is just running late and we will ask her where she has been, we are\\nless likely to feel bad.\\n2. Facilitators ask for two volunteers from the class. They give the volunteers one of the role-play\\nsituations. As soon as they depict the situation, they ask them to pause. They ask the student audience\\nwhat are some self-statements the role play actors can make to keep anger under control.\\nAppendices | 73Self-Instruction/talk examples (Role Play-1):\\n\"OK, “It’s alright. Keep calm” \"Be calm.\"\\n\"Relax.\"\\n\"She has changed her mind.\"\\n\"She must have forgotten about the firstjob.\"\\n“I’ll talk to her and find out what she wants.\"\\n\"Don\\'t worry about showing her mistake; she will be happy that both jobs were done”.\\nRepeat with the second role-play.\\nSelf-Instruction/talk examples (Role Play2):\\n\"Calm down.\"\\n\"Relax.\"\\n\"I did make a mistake.\"\\n\"He didn\\'t have to yell at me and over react that much but it won\\'t help to yell back.\"\\n\"Fix the problem, apologize and talk to him later about the yelling.\"\\nFacilitators summarize with key messages in the end of the activity.\\nKey Messages\\n\\uf0fc Our thoughts may influence our feelings and therefore behavior as a whole.\\n\\uf0fc If we give ourselves positive self-task during the provoking situation, we will be more likely to\\nrespond appropriately with others.\\nMental Health and Wellbeing — A Perspective | 74HANDOUT: CONTROLLING ANGER\\nSTEP 1: Prepare for the provoking situation\\nMake yourself ready for a potential conflict, if possible. Think of statements such as:\\n\"I can handle this. I know how to control my temper. This could get ugly, but I know how to handle myself. I’ll\\nremember to breathe. If it is not going well, I’ll calmly excuse myself and deal with it later.\"\\nSTEP 2: Confront with the provoking situation\\nWhile the problem situation is going on or after it has happened and you are about to address it, make\\nstatements such as:\\n\"Keep calm. Be cool. This is not that big of a deal. I will control the situation if I stay in control. Yelling and\\nscreaming is not going to solve anything. This person is really acting poorly, she must really be upset. I can help\\nthis person if I remain calm. I am not going to let him upset me.\"\\nSTEP 3: Coping with the arousal and stress\\nWhen you start to notice your body getting stressed and you may be losing your cool, make statements\\nsuch as:\\n\"I can feel my heart pounding, take a few breaths. My head is pounding, take a break and talk about it later. I have\\nreason to be annoyed, but I am going to stay in control. He can probably see that I am getting upset, but my voice\\nand words will be calm. Even though I am steaming, I am going to try to work this problem out. I am way too upset\\nto confront her; I will talk to her later.\"\\nSTEP 4: Self-Evaluation\\nAfter the provoking episode is over, think and make statements such as: “That was not so bad. I got a\\nlittle peeved, but I stayed in control. I did a good breathing exercise. My breathing helped me. I did a\\ngood job. I can see keeping my cool really helped in that situation.”\\nAppendices | 75Activity-7: Understanding and\\nDealing With Loss and Sadness\\nObjectives of the Activity Time: 45-60 minutes\\nStudents will\\n• Identify personal losses and share them with the group\\n• Understand the reactions to loss.\\n• Gain an understanding of the healthy ways of dealing with sadness and loss.\\nMaterials\\n• Copy of the ‘Loss Cycle Model’ for the peereducators.\\n• Pens or pencils, marker, board and chalk.\\nNote\\nIn this activity the peer educators must be accompanied with the teacher facilitator and they should be\\nempathetic in their discussion as this is a sensitive topic.\\nProcess\\n1. Peer educators divide the class into small group of 10-15 students. They ask the group members to\\nshare some episode when they felt really sad.\\n2. Then request each group to share their responses and write them on the black board. Common\\nresponses include the following:\\n• Someone passed away • We changed house.\\n• A friend moves away. • A brother or sister leaves home.\\n• A pet dies. • I failed in a subject.\\n3. The peer educators tell that sadness is a normal response to loss. It is an emotional suffering when\\nsomething/someone loves is taken away.\\n4. Peer educators brainstorm with the whole group by asking “How do people express sadness?” They\\nnote the responses on one side of the blackboard.\\n5. They then draw/display the “The Loss Cycle” and explain the stages of coping with sadness.\\nThe five stages of response to a loss or sadness\\n• Denial: “This can’t be happening to me.”\\n• Anger: “Why is this happening? Who is to blame?”\\n• Bargaining: “Make this not happen, and in return I will .”\\nMental Health and Wellbeing — A Perspective | 76• Depression: “I’m too sad to do anything.”\\n• Acceptance: “I’m at peace with what happened.”\\nNow, the peer educators ask the group, “What are some of the common false beliefs associated with\\nsadness?” Present each myth given below (attached here) and then the correct fact.\\n6. Peer educators summarize the session using the Key messages.\\nKey Messages\\n\\uf0fc Sadness is a natural response and a personal experience.\\n\\uf0fc How one experiences sadness depends on several factors, including temperament, personality traits\\nlife experiences, faith, severity of the loss and coping style.\\n\\uf0fc The responses to sadness are also varied and the grieving process takes time. There is no correct or\\nincorrect way to grief — but there are healthy ways to cope with the sadness.\\n\\uf0fc Family and friends are major part who supports us to overcome from the loss.\\nMYTHS AND FACTS ABOUT SADNESS\\nMYTH: The sadness will go away quickly if\\nyou ignore it or do not pay attention to it.\\n• Fact: Trying to ignore your sadness or keep\\nit from surfacing may only make it worse\\nfor future. For real healing, it is necessary\\nto face your sadness and actively deal\\nwith it.\\nMYTH: It is imperative to “be strong” in the\\nface of loss or pain.\\n• Fact: Feeling sad is a normal reaction to\\nloss. Crying never means that you are\\nweak. Showing your true inner feelings\\ncan help you as well as others to support\\nyou.\\nMYTH: If you don’t cry, it means you are not\\nsorry about the loss.\\n• Fact: Crying due to sadness is a normal\\nresponse. Crying is not the only way to\\nexpress pain or loss. It depends upon\\nindividual to individual.\\nAppendices | 77Activity -8: Improving Relationships\\nObjectives of the Activity Time: 30-40 minutes\\nStudents will\\n• Develop and practice listening skills.\\n• Learn different ways of effective communication with others.\\n• Understand another person’s view point- verbal and non-verbal – in a better way through\\ndemonstration.\\nInformation for Facilitators\\nCommunication is a two-way process. it is not merely talking and listening. Verbal communication is\\nonly one medium of communication between two or more people. Without using verbal cues, we can\\ncommunicate with our facial expression, gesture and body language. Appearance, posture, gait and voice\\ntell us more about people than words. These elements of interaction are called non-verbal communication.\\nExplain that because gestures and other non-verbal behaviors often represent a variety of emotions; it is\\neasy to “misread”them.\\nIt is important for the adolescents to understand that to be part of a group is one of the basic needs of\\npeople. Everyone wants to belong to their friend circle, also want to be recognized and appreciated by\\nothers. Sincere compliments help each other. A gift, like a compliment, makes them feel nice and raises\\ntheir confidence and self-esteem. Adolescents need to understand that they all are peers in “patches”,\\ni.e. friends may agree in some ways and disagree in others. You may stress that most of the time we lose\\nfriends due to misunderstanding that is caused by miscommunication.\\nProcess\\nIntroduce active listening through the following exercise.\\n1. Ask all the adolescents to pick one partner for these exercises.\\n2. Tell them to sit in certain postures as mentioned below, and ask them to discuss the topics\\ncorresponding to the future.\\nPosture Topic of discussion\\nSitting back to back Best movie that they have seen\\nOne sitting and the other standing The best moments that they cherished\\nBoth showing equal interest in the conversation by sitting face to face. Future plans\\n3. Following each demonstration, discuss with the adolescents about their feelings while assuming the\\nposture like:\\n• How did you feel making a conversation in this posture?\\n• How did it feel to listen actively to your partner?\\n• Was it different from the way you usually listen?\\n• How did it feel to be actively listened to?\\n4. Ask examples of times when adolescents have guessed wrong about how another person was feeling\\nor other have guessed wrong about their emotions.\\n5. What clues were they misreading?\\nMental Health and Wellbeing — A Perspective | 78Now\\n1. Ask each one of the adolescents to approach at least five other adolescents and give an appropriate\\ncompliment.\\n2. Then ask them to assemble back, ask them to share his or her own experiences by asking the following\\nquestions:\\n• What compliment did she/he receive and from whom?\\n• How did they feel when they receive the compliment? (Ask all the adolescents)\\n3. Ask them to give some imaginary gift (which can be called a “mental gift” to one another. Mental\\ngift is just an imaginary gift which could be abstract but should be understood and felt whereas; a\\ncompliment is appreciating one another’s appearance or some qualities. Mental gifts are what one\\nfeels like giving to another person- a positive enabling attribute that will help the other person.)\\n4. Discuss the following questions with the whole class on what “gift” they gave and received.\\nPossible Responses\\nCompliments\\n\\uf0d8 “Hi, you look nice.”\\n\\uf0d8 “Thanks, you did that really well.”\\n\\uf0d8 “Good luck for your exams.”\\n\\uf0d8 “Congratulations on your success.”\\nFeelings while receiving various compliments from others\\n\\uf0d8 “I was thrilled to get that compliment.”\\n\\uf0d8 “I felt over whelmed to listen to the best wishes from my friend.”\\n\\uf0d8 “I was happy and excited to receive congratulations.”\\n\\uf0d8 “I am glad to know that she said, I look nice, do I?’\\nMental Gifts\\n\\uf0d8 “I gift you the confidence.”\\n\\uf0d8 “I gift you the power to analyze situations.”\\n\\uf0d8 “I gift you the skill to communicate effectively.”\\nAssessment of Activity\\nAssess if the adolescents have demonstrated verbal and non-verbal ways of communication, and have\\nalso given compliments by way of gestures to all. Ask them to share at home with their parents whatever\\nthey learnt in the classroom.\\nAsk them to keep practicing the skills that they learnt. Tell them that they may maintain a diary in which\\nthey can note down the compliments and gifts that they give to people and the ones that receive from\\nothers.\\nKey-Messages\\n\\uf0fc Communicating with people help them to know the importance of having friends and family.\\n\\uf0fc Adolescents will become aware of their strength and their weaknesses in maintaining their\\nrelationships.\\n\\uf0fc Adolescents will be able to find out the reason for gaining worthy and unworthy relationships.\\nAppendices | 79Activity – 9 : Learning to Say “No”\\nObjectives of the Activity Time: 45-60 mins.\\nStudents will\\n• Understand peer pressure and how to be assertive under pressure.\\nMaterials\\n• Refusal techniques handout (for peer educator)\\nProcess\\n1. Students are asked about what they understand by the term \\'peer\\npressure’.\\n2. Ask them to give examples of real life situations when they have\\nexperienced this kind of pressure.\\n3. Randomly ask students to get up and give them situations to practice assertive response.\\nProblem 1 A cousin offers you a cigarette.\\nProblem 2 You see some older school children smoking at a school picnic.\\nProblem 3 You are preparing for examination and someone offers you some medicines to\\nincrease your concentration.\\nProblem 4 Your classmates offer you alcohol to try when you are attending a friend’s birthday\\nparty.\\nProblem 5 You have a stomachache and someone offers you a random medicine from a\\nstrange looking packet.\\nProblem 6 You see some of the seniors in your school transferring beer into empty coke cans\\nin the toilet on farewell party in your school.\\n4. Highlight whenever you see the participants showing characteristics of assertive communication.\\nKey points (Characteristics) of Assertive Communication\\n• Aware of others feelings\\n• Strong voice\\n• To the point and direct statements\\n• Statements beginning with ‘I’\\n• Confident and Honest\\n• Maintain Eye-to-eye contact\\n• Open to resolution of problem situation\\n5. Conclude the session by highlighting the following key messages.\\nKey Messages\\n\\uf0fc Peer pressure is likely to happen in almost everyone’s life.\\n\\uf0fc Certain level of positive peer pressure may be used for bringing about desirable change.\\n\\uf0fc Display the 10 commandments of substance abuse prevention. (as mentioned earlier)\\nMental Health and Wellbeing — A Perspective | 80Activity 10: Decision Making in the\\nFace of Peer Pressure\\nObjectives of the Activity Time: 45-60 minutes\\nStudents will\\n• Recognize the role of their own values in the decision-making process\\n• Encourage to think about possible changes in their values.\\nInformation for Facilitators\\nExplain to the adolescents that we all have to make many decisions, important ones as well as trivial\\nones. Some of our decisions will affect our whole life; others will have less of an effect. Our decisions\\nreflect on our values. Thus, decision making, is a process that involves assessment of one’s own values\\nand beliefs. This activity will make adolescents explore their own values through the choices they make\\nin a number of situations.\\nProcess\\n1. Distribute Alternatives and Decision-Making Exercise- as attached with this activity.\\n2. Ask them to carefully read each situation in the attachment and to consider their response before\\nlisting their choice as (a) or (b). Once the adolescents have responded to all the situations, have each\\none tally the number of (a) and (b) responses.\\n3. Now divide the class into small groups and ask them to discuss within their group\\nabout the responses to the various situations.\\n4. Encourage them to discuss their reasons for making each choice. Give 15 minutes for discussion\\nwithin the group.\\n5. Reassemble the groups for class discussion. Encourage discussion using the following questions.\\no How did you find the task of making decisions in the situations given? Difficult? Easy?Why?\\no Do you face similar situations in your life?\\no Why do you think it is difficult to stand firm in some situations?\\no What are the values involved in these situations?\\no Did you find yourself altering your choices after the group discussion? Why? What does that\\nindicate?\\nPossible Responses\\nExamples of responses to questions 1-5 are as follow:\\n1. It was difficult to make decisions in some situations because I felt uncertain.\\nAppendices | 812. Yes, we do face such similar situations in our life.\\n3. Sometimes we do get tempted because of friends.\\n4. The values are such that we have to be strong from within.\\n5. Yes, in some cases I changed my opinion as I found my friends were right. It indicates that we can\\nbe influenced by others.\\nAssessment of Activity:\\nAssess if the adolescents are able to recognize the role of their own values in the decision-making\\nprocess. Also, if they are able to make decisions after due consideration.In evaluating risky situations,\\nthe following questions can be helpful :\\n\\uf0fc What are the possible consequences of their decision?\\n\\uf0fc What are the short-term benefits (such as the feeling of fitting in) versus the possible long-term\\noutcomes (harmful)?\\n\\uf0fc Can peer pressure affect your decision-making process, if yes, then how?\\n\\uf0fc Where is the additional support or advice that you can seek, if you need it?\\nALTERNATIVES AND DECISION-MAKING EXERCISE\\nNo. Situation (a) (b)\\n1.

the end of the activity key messages  our thoughts may influence our feelings and therefore behavior as a whole  if we give ourselves positive selftask during the provoking situation we will be more likely to respond appropriately with others mental health and wellbeing — a perspective 74handout controlling anger step 1 prepare for the provoking situation make yourself ready for a potential conflict if possible think of statements such as i can handle this i know how to control my temper this could get ugly but i know how to handle myself i’ll remember to breathe if it is not going well i’ll calmly excuse myself and deal with it later step 2 confront with the provoking situation while the problem situation is going on or after it has happened and you are about to address it make statements such as keep calm be cool this is not that big of a deal i will control the situation if i stay in control yelling and screaming is not going to solve anything this person is really acting poorly she must really be upset i can help this person if i remain calm i am not going to let him upset me step 3 coping with the arousal and stress when you start to notice your body getting stressed and you may be losing your cool make statements such as i can feel my heart pounding take a few breaths my head is pounding take a break and talk about it later i have reason to be annoyed but i am going to stay in control he can probably see that i am getting upset but my voice and words will be calm even though i am steaming i am going to try to work this problem out i am way too upset to confront her i will talk to her later step 4 selfevaluation after the provoking episode is over think and make statements such as “that was not so bad i got a little peeved but i stayed in control i did a good breathing exercise my breathing helped me i did a good job i can see keeping my cool really helped in that situation” appendices 75activity7 understanding and dealing with loss and sadness
